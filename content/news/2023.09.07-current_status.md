On August 10, CIQ, Oracle and SUSE announced their intent to launch the Open Enterprise Linux Association (OpenELA). That announcement contained several key goals as well as the
principles the effort will be based upon to best achieve those goals.

The primary focus is to “__make accessible the sources, tooling, and assets to all members, collaborators, and the open source Enterprise Linux distribution developers to create
and maintain 1:1 downstream derivatives.__” We stated this clearly in the OpenELA mission as we recognize the whole effort is built on this clear focus being successful.

When CIQ, Oracle and SUSE started this effort we had full confidence it could be done, but we also recognized we didn't have all the answers – all the i’s dotted and t's crossed. But the
mission is clear. We know how it can be achieved. There's simply a lot of work to put the tools in place and pull the community together. We felt it was important to launch the intent as early as possible, as the power of open source is in creating an inclusive community. It wouldn’t be in the spirit of open source to invite others only when everything was complete.

To that end, we would love for others to get involved, no matter who you work for. All individuals and organizations are welcome. If you want to get involved, you may be thinking: what is next?

We've been busy the last couple weeks writing down the basics for organizing the source code, and defining the tools needed that will enable us to exploit automation and achieve the
continued compatibility paramount to this project.

Soon we'll post the draft technical documents outlining these concepts. The documents will contain enough context so that together we can set up the code and get it operational to the
point that it's beneficial to our community members. Once we get these documents fleshed out, the tools in place and the repositories completed, the project will be active and aligned with the principal OpenELA mission.
